# Recommendations with IBM

## Project Description
Recommend articles for users on the IBM Watson Studio platform using the following techniques:

1. Rank-Based Recommendations: Recommend most popular articles based on the highest user interactions
2. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: Make a more personal recommendation to a user by recommending unseen articles that were viewed by similar users
3. Content Based Recommendations: Recommend articles that are similar in content to a given article
4. Matrix Factorization: Use SVD to find new articles that a user will like to read
