## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How active are developers on Stack Overflow?
2. Is the developerâ€™s salary related to their activity on Stack Overflow?
3. Is the status of the user account related to user behavior? Can it be further utilized?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.`stack-overflow-developer-survey-2017.ipynb` The notebook has been exported to an html file.
The data is made up of two files: 
1. `survey_results_public.csv` - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. `survey_results_schema.csv` - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@mohancrskls/are-developers-salaries-influenced-by-their-activity-on-stack-overflow-8dc099b2acd0?postPublishedType=initial).
